Connect Four is a tried-and-true board game where the objective is to form a line of
four discs in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Players take turns dropping their discs
into the grid, aiming to outwith their opponent and form winning combinations. It's a game of
strategy and foresight, as players must plan ahead while blocking their rival's moves. This
project lies in the integration of AI, enabling players to engage with a computer opponent. This
AI-driven gameplay will make the experience enjoyable and challenging for players.
Through the project, we aim to capture the Connect Four while introducing a new dimension of
competition. The game ends with a victory for the player who achieves the line of four discs or
in a draw if the grid fills up without a winner. Connect Four provides fun and engaging
entertainment for all ages.
